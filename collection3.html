                            The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank is the personal account of a Jewish girl who went into hiding during World War II to escape Nazi persecution.

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Giving Tree is a simple yet profound story about a tree and its lifelong relationship with a young boy. From the time the boy is a child, the tree gives him everything it can: its apples to be sold, its branches for building, and its trunk for shelter. As the boy grows older, his needs increase, and the tree continues to give, even as it loses its own form. Eventually, the tree is reduced to a stump, and the boy, now an old man, returns to rest on it, finding contentment in the love that it has always offered. The book explores themes of unconditional love, sacrifice, and the complexities of giving. The relationship between the boy and the tree serves as a metaphor for selflessness and the emotional toll of giving without expecting anything in return. </p>
